            <h2> Flag </h2>
                <p>The German flag, in the colours black, red and gold, symbolises unity and freedom of the people. In Germany, the flag is colloquially known as the “Deutschlandfahne” - the Germany flag. 
                    Germany’s national flag changed several times due to political upheavals in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
                    </p>
                <p> The flag is a tricolour with three equally sized horizontal stripes. The colours have their roots in the early nineteenth century, when Germany was made up of many small states, most of which were ruled by the French Emperor Napoleon: during the Wars of Liberation that started in 1813, many students fought in the German units. They had no money for uniforms so they dyed their clothes black and wore them with gold buttons and red facings on the sleeves. 
                    The victory flag they waved resembled their uniforms. This flag is presumed to be the precursor to the German flag. Ever since, the colours have symbolised unity and freedom of the people.

            <h2>Brief Overview of the History of Germany</h2>

                <p>
                The area that is now Germany was inhabited by Germanic-speaking tribes for many centuries. They first became part of the Frankish Empire under the rule of Charlemagne, who is considered the father of the German monarchy. Much of Germany also became part of the Holy Roman Empire. From 1700 to 1918, the Kingdom of Prussia was established in Germany. In 1914, World War I broke out. Germany was on the losing side of the war and is estimated to have lost 2 million soldiers.
                </p>
                <p>
                In the wake of WWI, Germany tried to recover. There was revolution and the monarchy collapsed. Soon, a young leader named Adolf Hitler rose to power. He created the Nazi party, which believed in the superiority of the German race. Hitler became dictator and decided to expand the German empire. He started WWII and at first conquered much of Europe, including France. However, the United States, Britain, and the Allies managed to defeat Hitler. After the war, Germany was divided into two countries: East Germany and West Germany.
                </p>
                <p>
                East Germany was a communist state under the control of the Soviet Union, while West Germany was a free market state. The Berlin Wall was built between the two countries to prevent people from escaping from East Germany to the West. It became a central point and focus of the Cold War. However, with the collapse of the Soviet Union and communism, the wall was torn down in 1989. On October 3, 1990, East and West Germany were reunited into one country.
