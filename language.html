            <p>
                Germany is a multicultural, multilingual society, with a long history of many different languages and dialects being spoken. Many European languages, such as English and French, are considered to be Germanic languages as a result of the heavy influence of the Germanic people on Europe’s language development. It might not be an exaggeration to say that German is the “mother language” for much of Europe. 
                Today, 95% of people in Germany speak Standard German as their native language. Sixty-seven percent can speak at least one foreign language in addition to German, and 27% can speak at least two foreign languages.

                Standard German is the official language of Germany. It is a West Germanic language that is also the most commonly spoken first language in the European Union. Over 95% of the population of Germany speaks the language. This figure also encompasses speakers of Northern Low Saxon, a dialect of West Low German. The German language is closely related to Low German, English, Dutch, Afrikaans, and Frisian. 
                The writing system uses the Latin script. The vocabulary is mainly based on that of the Germanic branch of languages, but minorities of words are also derived from Greek, Latin, English, and French. German is one of the official and working languages of the European Union.

                Germans are known for their punctuality, efficiency, and strong sense of community. Daily life often reflects a structured, orderly rhythm—shops open and close on time, and people value direct communication and respect for personal space. Despite the stereotype of being reserved, many Germans are warm, helpful, and hospitable, especially once you get to know them. Family, environmental awareness, and enjoying time outdoors are important aspects of daily life.

                Germany is also home to a wide range of influential personalities across fields such as science, music, sports, and politics. From classical composers like Ludwig van Beethoven, Johann Sebastian Bach, and Clara Schumann to modern athletes like Michael Schumacher, and innovators like Albert Einstein, German figures have left a mark on global culture and history.
